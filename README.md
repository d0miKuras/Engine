## Renderer progress
After attempting to write a renderer so many times, I noticed that I get sidetracked mid-way and dig my self in a hole every time. This time I wanted to outline my plan clearly and use it as a guide to keep myself focused.
- Phase 1: Scaffolfing, Vulkan instantiation, clear screen.
- Phase 2: Static meshes, textures, materials, phong lighting
- Phase 3: Renderable textures, terrain, skybox, water (features)
- Phase 4: Post effects, configurable pipeline
- Phase 5: PBR
